BUT WHAT IS A GOOD TRADING AI?

I think that a good trading AI would have these capabilities:
    - Broader view / zoom out: any trader can zoom out and check previous sr zones
        etc. to check how will it affect the price. This means that other than the zoomed in view,
        the AI must have access to important events at those levels that happened also a long time ago

    - Dynamic positions: The capability to assess the accuracy of a guess and set the stop loss and
        take profit accordingly. May also vary on the type of position
